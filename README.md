# TT-2077
---------

TT-2077 or actually TT(I)-2077, is a holding space for an ideation (thanks for that word Aaron).
An  idea of an Airsoft based [LARP, LaRP, LArp, or LRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game) set in the world of Cyberpunk2077 focusing on the Trauma Team International Corporation and it's exploits through the players of the game. Either as street level recovery teams, Trauma room medics and support, or high rise dwelling fixers, and corporate entities.

There will be discussion here and thoughts and plans laid out over on Red Circle Games ([https://redcirclegames.co.uk/](https://redcirclegames.co.uk/))

Lets start with [https://abuxton.github.io/TT-2077](https://abuxton.github.io/TT-2077) and a simple Jekyll website and blog and the use of a Github repository for wiki, contributors and discussion (I may be just talking to my self a lot)
